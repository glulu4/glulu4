### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gabriel ( Gabby ) Lulu and I'm currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Economics. 
This is my GitHub. Sadly it's not comprehensive yet because the university prohibits me from publishing certain projects until I graduate. 
I'm currently looking for work as a software developer and anything of the like. I'd also love to collaborate on a project if anyone has ideas. 

### How to reach me
Please feel free to email me at glulu4444@gmail.com or 
leave a message on my website: https://gabbylulu.com/
